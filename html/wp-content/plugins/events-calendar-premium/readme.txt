1. Update your permalinks to ensure that the event specific rewrite rules take effect.
1. If you have trouble installing, see the [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for more helpful info.

= Activate =

No setup required. Just plug and play!

= Settings = 

There are a growing number of options you can set to make your calendar behave in a specific manner. Simple click The Event Calendar in the settings panel:

* Default View for Events: Select Calendar or Event list as the default view for the events view
* Default Country: Select the default country for creating events
* Embed Google Maps: Turn on embedded Google Maps and define the height and width of the map.
* Date / Time format is now managed via the default WordPress setting

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.1 or above
* WordPress 3.0 or above

== Documentation ==

The built in template can be overridden by files within your template.

= Default vs. Custom Templates =

The Events Calendar plugin comes with default templates for the list view, grid view and single post view, tailored to the 2010 default theme. If you would like to alter them, create a new folder called "events" in your template directory and copy over the following files from within the plugin folder (from the plugin's views/ directory):

* gridview.php
* list.php
* single.php
* events-list-load-widget-display.php
* events.css ( original in the plugin's resources/ directory )

Edit the new files to your hearts content. Please do not edit the one's in the plugin folder as that will cause conflicts when you update the plugin to the latest release.

New in 1.1: You may now also use the `sp_events_template_*` filter to override the default template behavior for .php template files. Eg: if you wanted gridview.php to reside in a folder called events-custom/ and wanted it to be called grid.php:


	add_filter('sd_events_template_gridview', 'my_gridview');
	function my_gridview($template) {
		return get_template_directory() . '/events-custom/grid.php';
	}

For events.css, the filter `sp_events_stylesheet_url` can be used to provide an alternate stylesheet. If your filter returns false, no events stylesheet will be loaded.

= Supported Variables and URLs =

This plugin registers the following rewrite rules, which controls which posts are available in the loop.  The number of posts returned defaults to 10, but is configurable by the $count parameter to sp_get_events().

events/upcoming 
?post_type=sp_events&eventDisplay=upcoming
  
Displays events starting today in ascending date order.
  
events/past
?post_type=sp_events&eventDisplay=past

Displays events that started before today in descending date order.
  
events/2010-01-02
?post_type=sp_events&eventDisplay=bydate&eventDate=2010-01-02

Displays only events that start on Jan 2, 2010.
